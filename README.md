# Project Euler
My attempts and solutions to the famous mathematical problems in Project Euler. 

## Purpose:
Plan to predominantly use Java for most solutions. May use other languages such as C, C++, Python or Haskell. I'll use Haskell because of its strong list comprehension for certain tasks and to get reacquainted with functional programming. As the problem difficulty increases, I expect to use Java, C, C++, and Python for more complete programs. Highly efficient programs will be done exclusively in pure C.    

## Goals
### Early on:
- Practice algorithm design.
- Create modular code.
 
### Later on:
- Extreme efficiency, especially Big-O performance.
- Truly approach problems like a mathematician.
