 * Project Euler: Problem 6
 * 
 * Sum square differencs:
 * 
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22 + ... +
 * 102 = 385
 *
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... +
 * 10)2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
 * first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 *
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
 * natural numbers and the square of the sum.
